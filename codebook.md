This code book is for the final project from courseras getting and cleaning data (wk4).
The goal of this codebook is to identify each of the variables for the 2 data sets.  Parts 1-Part 4 will be explained in section 1.  Part 5 will be covered in section 2.
Section 1: 
This section has 10,299 observations of 82 variables
Subject – is a numerical value identifying each person used in the test
Activity – Walking, Walking_upstairs, Walking_downstairs, Sitting, Standing and Laying
Time_x – A column that was derived from a time column
Freq_x – A column that was derived from a frequency column
Body_x – A column that was derived from body data
Gravity_x – A column that was derived from gravity data
Accelerometer_x – A column that was derived from an accelerometer sensor
Gyroscope_x – A column that was derived from a gyroscope sensor


Section 2:
This section is comprised of 180 observations of 81 variables and was derived by grouping activities and subjects.
Activity - Walking, Walking_upstairs, Walking_downstairs, Sitting, Standing and Laying
Subject – is a numerical value identifying each person used in the test
The remaining columns are the mean of each combination of activity and subject then updates the column names by added mean_ to the following data colulmns.
Time_x – A column that was derived from a time column
Freq_x – A column that was derived from a frequency column
Body_x – A column that was derived from body data
Gravity_x – A column that was derived from gravity data
Accelerometer_x – A column that was derived from an accelerometer sensor
Gyroscope_x – A column that was derived from a gyroscope sensor
